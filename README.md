# Project Overview

Macrophages play a vital role in mediating immune responses against pathogens and foreign materials. They display exceptional plasticity in response to environmental stimuli and are able to acquire a spectrum of activation states. The classification of macrophage morphology is an important aspect of investigating macrophage phenotype under different conditions. Therefore, there are significant benefits in developing fast image based approach that enables automated identification of different macrophage functional phenotypes by assessing cell morphology. This projects aims to developed a platform from which classified macrophage imaging data can be efficiently classififed and stored. This will create a solid foundation for the development machine learning algorithms to facilitate high-throughput automated image analysis.
